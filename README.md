# üëã Hi, I'm √Ålvaro 

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## üöÄ About Me

I am a computer science student from Spain who loves technology, video games, and reading.
I love learning new technologies. At university, I have been working with LaTeX,C, C++, JAVA, Vim, NVIM, Linux, and I am currently learning Python, how to configure my IDE with NeoVim (bc I don't have to rely on VSCode when developing), and a little bit of web development (backend).
Additionally, I have actively participated in the GUI (https://gui.inf.uva.es/) , which is an association at the University of Valladolid, in the role of secretary and community manager.
I have also given workshops for the university and participated in activities such as NATO's LockedShield.

- üå± Currently learning: Python and NeoVim
- üì´ How to reach me: @ALVPI on telegram 
- ‚ö° Fun fact: People know me as ALVPI, not √Ålvaro. If you want to know anything about me, it's easier to ask about ALVPI.
